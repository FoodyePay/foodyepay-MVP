# FoodyePay ChatGPT App Introduction

## Overview
FoodyePay is a crypto-native payment and rewards platform operating on the Base network. The ChatGPT app gives diners and restaurant partners a conversational interface to:
- Understand FoodyePay benefits and supported payment methods.
- Claim onboarding rewards and view reward status.
- Generate secure payment QR codes for in-person transactions.
- Retrieve transaction summaries or follow-up support information.

## Target Users
- **Diners**: Web3-savvy customers who hold FOODY tokens or want to complete payments through smart wallets.
- **Restaurant partners**: Operators who manage FoodyePay-enabled POS flows and need quick answers on settlement, verification, or rewards.
- **Support teams**: Internal FoodyePay staff can reuse the same tooling for troubleshooting and manual operations.

## Core Capabilities (MVP)
1. Reward management (eligibility checks, reward issuance confirmation, statistics).
2. Payment assistance (QR creation, payment intent summaries, transaction lookups) *(in progress—will be ready before submission)*.
3. Restaurant onboarding & compliance guidance (EIN verification, address validation) *(planned for Phase 2).*.
4. Customer support handoff with context logging and secure follow-up channels.

## Value Proposition
- **Faster onboarding**: Restaurants can resolve verification tasks in minutes using natural language.
- **Transparent rewards**: Diners see real-time status without navigating multiple dashboards.
- **Safe automation**: Risky actions run through authenticated tools with auditable logs, reducing manual ops load.

## Differentiators
- Deep integration with FoodyePay’s Supabase backend and Base-network smart contracts.
- Bilingual experience (English / Simplified Chinese) tuned for North America and APAC partners.
- Built-in compliance guardrails to protect payout flows while still providing self-serve access.

## Roadmap Highlights
- Phase 1 (submission): rewards + payment QR generation + support escalation.
- Phase 2: restaurant verification suite and automated marketing prompts.
- Phase 3: personalized analytics (weekly spend, loyalty offers) powered by aggregated transaction insights.

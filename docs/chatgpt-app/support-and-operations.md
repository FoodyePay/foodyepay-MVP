## Escalation Workflow
1. Support triages incoming ticket, verifies ChatGPT App user identity.
2. For P0/P1 issues, escalate to on-call engineer and operations lead.
3. Track remediation in Jira project `FOODYE-MCP` with clear owner and ETA.
4. Post-mortem for every P0 within 72 hours, shared internally.

## Tool-Specific Playbooks
- **Reward Eligibility**: Confirm diner wallet, rerun eligibility tool, cross-check Supabase logs.
- **Reward Issuance**: Validate transaction hash in Base explorer, confirm Supabase reward ledger entry.
- **Reward Statistics**: Reconcile totals with daily finance dashboard export.
- Future tools will have appended runbooks before release.

- Alerts trigger when error rate >2% over 5 minutes or latency >3s p95.
- Supabase row-level security violations trigger notifications to security@foodyepay.com.

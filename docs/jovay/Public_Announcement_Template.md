# FOODY is coming to Jovay (AntChain) — Official Bridge Mapping Announcement

Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
Status: Prepared — Publish upon AntChain approval

## What’s happening
We are onboarding FOODY (Foodye Coin) to AntChain/Jovay as the official cross-chain mapping from Base Mainnet. Once live, users can bridge FOODY between Base and Jovay using the official AntChain Bridge.

## Why this matters
- Access Jovay ecosystem dApps and liquidity with FOODY
- Preserve 1:1 supply parity via Proof-of-Reserves
- Lower fees and faster confirmations on an EVM-compatible L2

## How to bridge (will be updated at launch)
1) Visit the official AntChain Bridge: https://{bridge.domain}
2) Connect your wallet and select chains: Base ↔ Jovay
3) Choose FOODY, enter amount, confirm
4) Wait for confirmations; your FOODY (or wFOODY) arrives on Jovay/Base

## Contract addresses
- FOODY on Base (canonical): 0x{BASE_TOKEN_ADDRESS}
- Bridge Reserve Vault (Base): 0x{RESERVE_VAULT}
- FOODY on Jovay (mapped): 0x{JOVAY_TOKEN_ADDRESS}
- Bridge Contracts: {links to explorers}

## Proof-of-Reserves (PoR)
- Reserve address and issuance address are public and verifiable 24/7
- Dashboard: https://{por.dashboard}
- Policy: 1:1 minted on Jovay equals FOODY locked on Base

## Risks and disclosures
- Cross-chain involves smart contract and operational risk. AntChain Bridge and FOODY governance implement limits, monitoring, and pause controls
- Expect network gas and bridge fees; finality time varies by network conditions
- Only use official domains and verified contracts listed here

## FAQ
- Is the Jovay token the same as Base FOODY? It’s a canonical mapped representation with 1:1 backing
- Will there be a ticker change? Ticker remains FOODY; symbol on some UIs may display “wFOODY” depending on implementation
- Can I go back to Base? Yes, redemptions are supported via the bridge

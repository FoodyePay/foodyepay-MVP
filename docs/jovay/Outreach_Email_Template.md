Subject: FOODY (Foodye Coin) — Request for AntChain/Jovay Bridge Onboarding & Whitelist Access

Hi AntChain/Jovay Team,

We operate FOODY (Foodye Coin), an ERC-20 on Base Mainnet. We would like to onboard FOODY as an official mapped asset on Jovay via AntChain Bridge and request information about cooperation/whitelist access.

What we can provide immediately:
- Asset metadata, verified contract source, and TokenList JSON
- Brand/trademark authorization and logo assets
- Governance and security details (multi-sig, roles, monitoring)
- Proof-of-Reserves model and addresses (1:1 Base reserves)
- Audit reports or scheduled audit timeline

Questions / Requests:
1) Current status of the public bridge and onboarding timeline
2) Required materials and review process for asset listing
3) Testnet/Mainnet endpoints and any chain plugin requirements
4) Contract verification and explorer support for Jovay
5) Contacts for security coordination and incident response

We’ve attached a one-page onboarding package for quick review. Happy to provide anything else needed and to schedule a short call.

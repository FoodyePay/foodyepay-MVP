**Subject: The Story of FoodyePay & Our Vision for the Future (UHI Final Interview)**

**Dear Taylor Scully,**

I am writing to you with great anticipation for our final interview tomorrow. To give you a fuller picture of the vision behind FoodyePay and to bridge any potential language gaps, I wanted to share the story of our journey—a journey that began with a single, real-world problem: **the 3% fee** draining the lifeblood from my family’s restaurant.

This simple problem sparked a multi-year quest to build a better financial system. Our path was one of rapid evolution:
*   We first created `FoodyeCoin`, an upgradeable ERC20 token built for the long term.
*   We faced the "moving sniper" problem of double volatility with an `ETH` pairing, forcing us to pivot to a stable `USDC` anchor on a Layer 2.
*   We then hit the regulatory "great wall," which led to our biggest breakthrough: a strategy of **standing on the shoulders of giants**. We integrated **Coinbase** for non-custodial wallets and user on-ramping (KYC), and **Stripe** for business verification and fiat off-ramping (KYB). Our entire infrastructure is secured by our third giant, **Google Cloud**.

This hybrid Web2/Web3 architecture solved the puzzle of creating a secure, compliant, and user-friendly payment bridge. However, it left one final bottleneck: a slow, risky, manual settlement process.

This is why we designed the **`RwaSettlementHook` for Uniswap V4**. It’s the automated engine designed to demolish that final bottleneck, enabling atomic, on-chain settlement for real-world commerce. It’s the culmination of our entire journey.

FoodyePay is just the beginning. It is the gateway to a much larger vision: the **"Foodye Empire"** (`Foodye.io`), an ecosystem including `FoodyeMenuNFT`, `FoodyeRWA`, `FoodyeGame`, and `FoodyeVerse`, all designed to revolutionize the culinary industry.

I am an entrepreneur driven to solve real-world problems with technology. The story above is just a summary of a journey filled with challenges and breakthroughs. If you are interested, I have attached a more detailed narrative: **"The FoodyePay Saga: A Founder's Journey."**

I am incredibly excited to discuss this vision with you tomorrow.

**Best regards,**

**Ken Liao**
**Founder, Foodye.io**

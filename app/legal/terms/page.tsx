      <h2>13. Specific Terms for FoodyeMenuNFT</h2>
      <p>The Service may in the future include access to the FoodyeMenuNFT platform or similar features, which allow users to create, manage, and interact with non-fungible tokens ("NFTs") and other digital assets.

      <h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless FoodyePay Technology, Inc., its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Service; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms; or (iii) your violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or the rights of any third party.</p>

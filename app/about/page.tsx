              <p>
                I’m a builder who executes relentlessly. I didn’t come from a typical Silicon Valley track — I started in the U.S. Navy, working on electronic systems aboard a warship where reliability and safety are non-negotiable. Later I worked at NYC DOT managing mission-critical infrastructure. Those environments shaped how I build today: simple, robust, verifiable systems that never fail silently.

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-400">The Spark: It Started with a Cake</h2>
              <p>
                In 2024, everything started with a cake. I ordered a cake from a friend’s bakery in Flushing, and during checkout he joked: “Do you have Bitcoin? I can accept it.”
              </p>

                That single sentence unlocked the entire insight behind FoodyePay.

              <p>I realized that while the desire was there, the infrastructure was missing:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4 text-gray-300">
                <li>Restaurants lack compliant Web3 onboarding</li>
                <li>Diners lack easy KYC/on-ramp into crypto</li>
                <li>Menus don’t exist natively onchain</li>
                <li>Web3 payments don’t fit real-world workflows</li>
                <li>And AI has no standard for verifiable, onchain economic actions</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-6">
                From that tiny spark, I built everything myself:

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4 text-gray-300">
                <li>Designed FoodyeCoin + FoodyePay from scratch</li>
                <li>Solved diner KYC via Coinbase Smart Wallet</li>
                <li>Solved restaurant KYC via Stripe Connect</li>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-400">The Uniswap v4 Breakthrough</h2>
              <p>
                The announcement of Uniswap v4 and its "hook" architecture was a watershed moment. It was the missing piece of the puzzle. Hooks provided the exact mechanism needed: a way to execute custom code at critical points in a liquidity pool's lifecycle. This was the key to building a truly on-chain, automated, and ultra-low-cost settlement system.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Months of intense research and development led to the creation of the <code className="bg-gray-800 p-1 rounded text-sm font-mono">'RwaSettlementHook'</code>. This wasn't just code; it was a new paradigm for real-world asset (RWA) payments. It allowed for atomic, on-chain settlement, splitting payments to the restaurant, calculating taxes, and distributing fees, all in a single, seamless transaction. Our acceptance into the Uniswap Hook Incubator was a powerful validation of this vision.

              <p>
                Today, FoodyePay is more than just a payment processor. We are building the financial infrastructure for the next generation of commerce. Our vision extends beyond simple payments to a future of dynamic, data-driven liquidity and programmable finance for small businesses.

              <p className="mt-4">
                Our journey is one of relentless innovation, driven by the belief that technology can create a more equitable and efficient world. We started with a simple problem in a restaurant, and now we're building a global solution on the frontier of DeFi. This is just the beginning.
